# **31Â  Information Dashboard Design: R methods**

## **31.1 Overview**

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   create bullet chart by using ggplot2,

-   create sparklines by using ggplot2 ,

-   build industry standard dashboard by using R Shiny.

## **31.2 Getting started**

For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, the following R packages will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(lubridate, ggthemes, reactable,
reactablefmtr, gt, gtExtras, tidyverse)
```

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) provides a collection of functions for performing data science task such as importing, tidying, wrangling data and visualising data. It is not a single package but a collection of modern R packages including but not limited to [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) and [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/).

-   [lubridate](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap31) provides functions to work with dates and times more efficiently.

-   [ggthemes](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap31) is an extension of ggplot2. It provides additional [themes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) beyond the basic themes of ggplot2.

-   [gtExtras](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/) provides some additional helper functions to assist in creating beautiful tables with [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), an R package specially designed for anyone to make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language.

-   [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) provides functions to create interactive data tables for R, based on the [React Table](https://github.com/tanstack/table/tree/v7) library and made with [reactR](https://github.com/react-R/reactR).

-   [reactablefmtr](https://kcuilla.github.io/reactablefmtr/) provides various features to streamline and enhance the styling of interactive reactable tables with easy-to-use and highly-customizable functions and themes.

## **31.3 Importing Microsoft Access database**

### **31.3.1 The data set**

For the purpose of this study, a personal database in Microsoft Access mdb format called *Coffee Chain* will be used.

### **31.3.2 Importing database into R**

In the code chunk below, `odbcConnectAccess()` of [**RODBC**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/) package is used used to import a database query table into R.

```{}
```
