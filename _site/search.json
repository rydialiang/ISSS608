    "text": "6.1 Overview\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R."

However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n6.7.1 Getting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\n\nShow the code\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n6.7.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"circle\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"square\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"number\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"shade\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3 Working with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"shade\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"shade\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.pos = \"lt\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.cex = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         cl.pos = \"r\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.4 Working with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"shade\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"shade\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n6.7.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\n\nShow the code\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.6 Reorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"shade\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"shade\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to “scatterPlotMatrix”"

    "text": "14.5 Creating Interactive Heatmap\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n14.5.1 Working with heatmaply\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Data trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n14.5.2.1 Scaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.2 Normalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.3 Percentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Clustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n14.5.4 Manual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.5 Statistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\n\nShow the code\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\n\nShow the code\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.6 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.7 Working with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.8 The finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "15.1 Overview\nParallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

    "section": "15.4 Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot",
    "text": "15.4 Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n15.4.1 Plotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\n\nShow the code\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n15.4.2 Plotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\n\nShow the code\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\n\n\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Parallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\n\nShow the code\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n15.4.4 Rotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Adjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\n\nShow the code\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

    "section": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n16.4.1 Designing a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\n\nShow the code\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%   filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Using the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n16.4.3 Working with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.4 Colours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n16.4.5 The “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.6 The “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nThe colour scheme used is very confusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.7 Treemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n16.4.8 Working with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.9 Using sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"
